### Notes:

* Similiar lure to the fake HSBC scam, urgent need for action with points.
* Using VirusTotal can see three security vendors have flagged the website as a phishing site or suspicious.
* Looking on urlscan we can see the site is down. Perhaps it has been taken down unless it is using Cloudflare's bot fight mode.
