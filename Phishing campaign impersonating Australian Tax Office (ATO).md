### Notes:

* A SMS text I received a few days ago.
* I wasn't able to access the phishing page at first. When I looked in the dev tools I could see it is using Cloudflare's Bot Fight Mode. h/t to @BushidoUK for this tip.
* The aim of the site is to collect users personal information by pretending to set up their ATO user account.
* The phishing site opens to a sign in page and then moves to a enter a SMS verification code. I was able to step through the phishing kit by entering fake information. 
* The next page was to set up secret questions. The target user can either set up secret questions which provide more personal data.
* There is a skip button to bypass this and progress further.
* The next page asks for Name and Date of Birth.
* The message says a medicare card and drivers licence is needed but only the drivers licence needs to be uploaded before it finishes up.
* The next page is clumsily worded with a typo but also mentioning income statement. The browser then pivots to the actual ATO website.
* Time for some OSINT research. The Whois record gives us a few pieces of intel:
  - Date created: 2025-04-24
  - Registrar: Nicenic 
  - Host: Cloudflare
* A interesting discovery is searching for the filename "hvck33m[.]php". A large list of phishing pages using that same file.
