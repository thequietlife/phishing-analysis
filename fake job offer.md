### Where: 
iMessage. 

### How: 
Batches of iMessages are sent out in the hope of finding someone who is in-between jobs, job-hunting or needs to make some money quickly. The victim sends a WhatsApp message and is then filled in on the job. The job is described as helping “Temu” merchants get better ratings. The tasks is to give products 4 or 5 star ratings. 

### Why: 
The victim needs to deposit money to commence and then deposit more money to get all their “earnings”. It appears to be a gamified approach as it uses tactics such as “lucky tasks”, “upgrade my tier to VIP3”.

### Timeline Analysis:

* Initial WhatsApp message explains optimizing apps
* Victim needs to deposit $100 to start. This “resets” the tasks. Each victim gets 120 tasks which are divided into 3 sets to 40
* “Lucky tasks” means the victim has to get their account out of the negative by finishing their tasks. They get a bonus for each task completed and can then withdraw the money they have “earned”. They can also earn a higher bonus if they “win”
* Once the victim earns a certain amount of money, e.g. $1500, they need to deposit $5000 to withdraw all their earnings
