## Week ending 8 Feb 2025

I did a search of scam texts during the week. I found the following scam texts:
- fake job interview meeting details
- tax department (US tax time)
- tolls
- gift cards (steam/discord and one tied in with a romance baiting scam)

[Interpol has listed 5 rising online threats](https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Cybercrime/Stay-Safe-Navigating-online-risks-with-awareness):

1. Ransomware attacks
2. Malware attacks
3. Scams and generative AI
4. Phishing 
5. Romance baiting (previously referred to as pig butchering)

I found the scam text analysis done by [Unit 42](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel) really interesting and helpful. In particular seeing how to structure analysis and provide
actionable intelligence. I realised I needed to next set up a lab to safely analyse scam texts and emails.
