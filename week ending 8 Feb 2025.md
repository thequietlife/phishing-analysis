## Week ending 8 Feb 2025

I did a search of scam texts during the week. I found the following scam texts:
- fake interview
- tax department (US tax time)
- tolls
- gift cards (steam/discord and one tied in with a romance baiting scam)

Interpol has listed 5 rising online threats:
1. phishing
2. romance baiting (previously referred to as pig butchering)
3. ransomware attacks
4. generative AI fraud
5. malware attacks

I found the scam text analysis done by [Unit 42](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel) really interesting and helpful. In particular seeing how to structure analysis and provide
actionable intelligence. I realised I needed to next set up a lab to safely analyse scam texts and emails.
