## üéÆ Steam gift card analysis

I did a search of scam texts during the week. I found the following scam texts:
- fake job interview meeting details
- tax department (US tax time)
- tolls
- gift cards (steam/discord and one tied in with a romance baiting scam)

Here is a closer look at the Steam gift card scam I found on x.com

‚ö†Ô∏è A post about "free" gaming gift cards is enticing. 
Our first step is to search for the URL on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).

When we add the URL on VirusTotal we can see the [IP address](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/119.18.49.15/details) 
and [URL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/967a9ba159499f8a5821c0665a8b3bb0a0621e7bb7ba65b825e7792a6bf2cff9) have been marked malicious.
