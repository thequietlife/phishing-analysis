## Week ending 8 Feb 2025

I did a search of scam texts during the week. I found the following scam texts:
- fake job interview meeting details
- tax department (US tax time)
- tolls
- gift cards (steam/discord and one tied in with a romance baiting scam)

Here is a closer look at the gift card scam I found on x.com

⚠️ A post about free gaming gift cards. "Free" gift cards is enticing. When we check out the URL on VirusTotal it confirms that it is a sus website.
