## üéÆ Steam gift card analysis

I did a search for scams during the week. I found the following:
- fake job interview meeting details
- tax department (US tax time)
- tolls
- gift cards (steam/discord and one tied in with a romance baiting scam)

Here is a closer look at the Steam gift card scam I found on x.com

‚ö†Ô∏è A post about "free" gaming gift cards is enticing. 
Our first step is to search for the URL on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).

We can try some other tools to dig for more information. Let's go with [DomainTools](https://whois.domaintools.com/)

The search shows several security companies have marked the URL as malicious.
When we select Details we can find the IP address:

alt="VirusTotal screenshot for freegiftcodegenerator[.]com IP address" width="300"/>

The IP address has been marked as malicious.
Next we can select Relations in VirusTotal:

alt="VirusTotal screenshot for freegiftcodegenerator[.]com Relations" width="300"/>

Here we can see one URL that has been flagged and several results for malicious files.

We can dig a bit further by using some other tools. Using DomainTools we can have a look at the Whois Record.

alt="Whois record from DomainTools" width="300"/>

The Whois record gives us the date the site was created, the company it is registered with and the website host. 
- It was created on 2015-05-2. üï∞Ô∏è Ten years ago!
- It was registered with PDR - PublicDomainRegistry[.]com
- Hosted by Bluehost.

Here we find a screenshot of the freegiftcodegenerator[.]com website. üö® The website looks pretty basic and the logo branding does not look real.

Running the URL through urlscan gives us a bit more information:<br>

alt="screenshot of urlscan results done again shows a different IP address" width="300"/>

Well that was an interesting one to start with. <br>
