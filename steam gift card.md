## üéÆ Steam gift card analysis

I did a search of scam texts during the week. I found the following scam texts:
- fake job interview meeting details
- tax department (US tax time)
- tolls
- gift cards (steam/discord and one tied in with a romance baiting scam)

Here is a closer look at the Steam gift card scam I found on x.com

‚ö†Ô∏è A post about "free" gaming gift cards is enticing. 
Our first step is to search for the URL on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload).

The search shows several security companies have marked the URL as malicious.
When we select Details we can find the IP address:
