About: A recent phishing campaign has used a fake request to appear on a TechCrunch podcast as its lure. Posing as a TechCrunch journalist they approached
startup founders and ask them to appear on a podcast. 

Where: X.com via a DM

How: The calendar invite appears to be a Google calendar invite. But the URL actually is a malicious Calendly link. The URL is shortened thereby hiding 
it's true address. Once the invite had been accepted the threat actor has access to edit the victim's X account. They are able to pose as the victim and 
post a crypto token promotion; delete the victim's bio and pinned posts.
