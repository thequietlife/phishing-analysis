The Federal Election was called today and the texts have started. This one is for postal voting, but it is not linking to the Australian Electoral Commission.

### Notes:

* Call spoofing/caller id spoofing used so it looks like it is from the Liberal Party
* The Whois record gives us a few pieces of intel
  - Date created: not new, 1327 days ago
  - Registrar: Synergy Wholesale
  - Host: Cloudflare
  - IP address
* The screenshots look sketchy, one version is in German.
* When compared to the wording on Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) it is missing some bullet points.
* If it is legit, why isn't it linking to the AEC?
